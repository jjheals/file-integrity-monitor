# file-integrity-monitor
I was researching and brainstorming project ideas when I came across the idea of creating a FIM. Originally, I was going to do it in Python, but with some more research I found that FIMs are more powerful in PowerShell, since PowerShell comes pre-installed on all windows operating systems. It also allows smoother access to the directories, which is a core part of a FIM (by nature).

--> This project is currently a work in progress, and it is my first major project in PowerShell. Some aspects may be slightly inefficient/could be done in a better way, but this project is mostly just for me to experiment with PS and get the basics down. I will continue to update and increase efficiency as I learn more about the language. (6/07/22)
