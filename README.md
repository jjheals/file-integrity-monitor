# file-integrity-monitor
I was researching and brainstorming project ideas when I came across the idea of creating a FIM. Originally, I was going to do it in Python, but with some more research I found that FIMs are more powerful in PowerShell, since PowerShell comes pre-installed on all windows operating systems. It also allows smoother access to the directories, which is a core part of a FIM (by nature).

--> (6/07/22) This project is currently a work in progress and it is my first major project in PowerShell. I know some aspects may be slightly inefficient or could be done in a better way, but this projoect is mostly for me to experiment with PS and get the basics down. I will continue to update this repo with updated and more efficient code as I learn more about the language, but enjoy for now!

--> (6/07/22) I also included some folders and files, incase you want to download and test it yourself. Please reach out if you find any holes or broken logic!
